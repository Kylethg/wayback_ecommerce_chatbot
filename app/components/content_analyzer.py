        Guidelines for your analysis:
        1. Focus on concrete observations before making interpretations
        2. Identify specific promotional mechanics (e.g., "20% off with code SAVE20" rather than just "discount")
        3. Note price points and thresholds (e.g., "Free shipping on orders over Â£50")
        4. Identify featured brands, categories, or products and their prominence

        6. Format your response with clear sections and bullet points
